    "1.   What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "ANS- The Filter method is a feature selection technique in machine learning that ranks or scores individual features based on their relevance or \n",
    "     importance to the prediction task. It works independently of any specific machine learning algorithm and focuses on evaluating each feature \n",
    "     separately. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Here is a brief explanation of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Evaluation: Each feature is evaluated independently, without considering its relationship with other features or the target variable. \n",
    "                       Various statistical measures like correlation, chi-squared test, mutual information, or statistical tests such as ANOVA can be \n",
    "                       used to assess the relevance of a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ranking or Scoring: After evaluating the features, they are assigned a rank or score based on their individual merit. Features with higher scores \n",
    "                       are considered more important or informative for the prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Selection: The top-ranked features are selected for further analysis or model building. This selection can be based on a predetermined \n",
    "                      number of features or a threshold value set by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Training: The selected features are then used to train a machine learning model. By focusing on the most relevant features, the model can \n",
    "                   potentially achieve better performance, faster training times, and reduced complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of the Filter method is its simplicity and computational efficiency since it doesn't involve building and evaluating a predictive \n",
    "model. However, it doesn't consider feature interactions or their relationship with the target variable, which can limit its effectiveness. \n",
    "Therefore, it is often used as a preliminary step in feature selection before applying more advanced techniques like Wrapper methods or Embedded \n",
    "methods that consider feature interactions within the context of a specific machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Filter method ranks or scores individual features based on their relevance, allowing the selection of the most important features for \n",
    "model training. While it is simple and efficient, it may overlook important feature combinations. Nonetheless, it serves as a useful initial step in \n",

    "Q2.  How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "ANS- The Wrapper method is a feature selection technique that differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates features by considering their \n",

    "     feature subsets by repeatedly training and evaluating a model using different combinations of features. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Here is a concise explanation of the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Evaluation: In the Wrapper method, features are evaluated in the context of a specific machine learning algorithm. Different subsets of \n",
    "                       features are tested to determine their impact on the model's performance. This approach considers the interaction between \n",
    "                       features and their relationship with the target variable.\n",

    "3. Model Performance: The performance of the machine learning algorithm serves as the criterion for evaluating feature subsets in the Wrapper method. \n",
    "                      The model is trained and evaluated multiple times using different combinations of features, allowing for a more comprehensive \n",
